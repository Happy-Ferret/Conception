Contributing
============

In general, contributions are welcome.

But be aware, this C++ version of Conception is deprecated in favor of the Go version. The Go version is being actively developed, and represents the future of the project.

Small bug fixes are fine, but if you're gonna spend time on it, I recommend to start looking at the Go version instead. A lot of the problems of the C++ version no longer exist in the Go version.
